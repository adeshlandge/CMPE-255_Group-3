# CMPE-255_Group-3:   RESTAURANT SUCCESS PREDICTION BASED ON YELP DATASET
Github repo for CMPE 255 Group3 final project.

<br/>


The primary objective of our analysis is to help in the success of restaurants in the United States. For a restaurant to be
successful, it has to satisfy certain parameters. We have chosen the following criteria for a restaurant to be a success:
- Choose a popular cuisine which is liked by most of the people.
- Choose a popular location.
- Choose certain cuisines which are popular in a certain location.
- Choose which has positive reviews.
- Choose a location where the trend of restaurant closure is almost none.
- Must have an average star rating of 3.5 or above.
- Choose an area which has lower noise levels.
- Higher footfall rate as compared to other similar restaurants.
We divided our investigation into many use cases in order to comprehend and forecast the success of a restaurant. On this
dataset, we have implemented classification models using the relevant machine learning approaches, which may help us
identify the solutions to the questions raised above.
<br/>
Below are the two use cases we worked upon:<br/>
<b>Use Case 1:</b> Location and Cuisine Analysis.<br/>
<b>Use Case 2:</b> Noise, Gender, Footfall pattern and Business Closure analysis.
